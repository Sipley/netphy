Cataloguing progress in figuring out what netphy code is doing

## 2019-09-06

Forked lukejharmon/netphy & cloned to local repository at `~/Desktop/idaho/netphy/` & cd into new directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sipley/netphy.git
cd netphy
```

Began trying to run through installation code, installing dependencies etc, to run:
```bash
bash sandbox.sh
```

However, I just stumbled upon this: `https://rdrr.io/github/lukejharmon/netphy/` & tried running installation code, which appears to have worked?
```R
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lukejharmon/netphy")
```
Not exactly sure what that means yet...
